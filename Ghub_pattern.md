## 4. Compatibility Justification

- **CPU + Motherboard**: The AMD Ryzen 5 5600G and Gigabyte A520M K V2 are fully compatible because they share the AM4 socket, the motherboard chipset supports Ryzen 5000 CPUs, and memory speed support aligns perfectly.
- **CPU Cooler**: Supports AM4 socket mounting so it's perfect for the CPU. Affordability while it keeps the CPU cool and quiet even under load.
- **RAM**: DDR4 memory is supported by the motherboard and cpu. 16 GB is good for gaming and productivity especially on lowend. A single stick leaves room for upgrading.
- **STORAGE**: The motherboard has an M.2 slot for NVMe drives, installation is easier. 1 TB storage, especially PCIe Gen 4 SSDs is good for OS, programs, and games at once, there's faster read/write speeds compared to SATA
- **CASE**: The case supports the MicroATX motherboard and clearance of GPU up to ~300mm. CPU cooler clearance is also up to 160mm. It's a good choice for it's affordability with decent airflow, modern design, and compact space.
- **PSU**: This fits the case, and PSU wattage is sufficient for this build since there's no given GPU. Bronze efficiency ensures reliability.

## 5. Budget Analysis

- **Budget Limit**: ₱20,000
- **Final Total**: ₱19,965
- ✅ Within budget
- Notes: Better CPU with overclocking to handle better graphics, no GPU, and just right PSU wattage.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

CONCLUSION: When creating our custom PC build, we noticed a significant price difference between international vendors and Local suppliers in Manila. International listings are often cheaper; once the shipping fees and taxes are considered, buying locally becomes the more practical choice. Local vendors also offer faster transactions and warranty support, making them more reliable overall. When searching for stock and affordable alternatives, popular components such as RAM and SSDs are often in short supply, and some cheaper options come from unfamiliar brands. This forced us to balance price, availability, and reliability, so we had to stay flexible when sourcing parts. Through this process, we learned the importance of compatibility and system design. From matching CPUs and motherboards to ensuring enough power supply wattage, we saw how each component affects overall performance and upgrade potential. More than just buying parts, building a PC requires careful planning, cost analysis, and technical understanding.
