## 1. Introduction

Briefly describe your project build (1–2 paragraphs).  
Mention: target use case (e.g., general-purpose desktop, gaming, programming, data science, etc.) and budget constraint.
Our aim is to make an entry level budgeted gaming PC. AMD based CPU with that will be suitable for light 720p gaming and we have a budget of 20,000.

## 4. Compatibility Justification

- **CPU + Motherboard**: The AMD Ryzen 5 5600G and Gigabyte A520M K V2 are fully compatible because they share the AM4 socket, the motherboard chipset supports Ryzen 5000 CPUs, and memory speed support aligns perfectly.
- **CPU Cooler**: Supports AM4 socket mounting so it's perfect for the CPU. Affordability while it keeps the CPU cool and quiet even under load.
- **RAM**: DDR4 memory is supported by the motherboard and cpu. 16 GB is good for gaming and productivity especially on lowend. A single stick leaves room for upgrading.
- **STORAGE**: The motherboard has an M.2 slot for NVMe drives, installation is easier. 1 TB storage, especially PCIe Gen 4 SSDs is good for OS, programs, and games at once, there's faster read/write speeds compared to SATA
- **CASE**: The case supports the MicroATX motherboard and clearance of GPU up to ~300mm. CPU cooler clearance is also up to 160mm. It's a good choice for it's affordability with decent airflow, modern design, and compact space.
- **PSU**: This fits the case, and PSU wattage is sufficient for this build since there's no given GPU. Bronze efficiency ensures reliability.

## 5. Budget Analysis

- **Budget Limit**: ₱20,000
- **Final Total**: ₱XX,000
- ✅ Within budget / ❌ Over budget
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket cooler, etc.).

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

Reflections on:

- Price differences (international vs. Manila vendors)
- Challenges in finding stock or cheaper equivalents
- What the group learned about PC components and system design
